# pandasDataEngineeringMockup

Planning notes and how I organized my thoughts before coding are found in the excel sheet named "data review notes and planning."

Because this is a mockup, I wrote this email to the client to ask some important clarifying questions on how to handle the data I was processing, and that is also included.

I wrote the pandas data processing in a Jupyter notebook, the .ipnyb file. I prefer to work through data that way because it's easier to run step by step and get better visualizations as to how it's going.
However, I translated it into a python script file as well. using the commandline (jupyter nbconvert x.ipynb --to python)

Data input and output is in the corresponding folders
